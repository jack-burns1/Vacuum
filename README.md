# Vacuum.py

Run with: python3 vacuum.py

Instructions:

A decision tree implementation of a theoretical roomba vacuum cleaner User is prompted to input the battery 
level (an integer between 0 and 100), and whether they want to spot clean and/or general clean (input must 
be "true" or "false" - case insensitive). After 50 tree evaluations, if the roomba is not running a task, the 
user is asked if they want to continue (true/false - case insensitive). If true, the user is again prompted
as to whether they want to spot and/or general clean. If false, the roomba quits.
